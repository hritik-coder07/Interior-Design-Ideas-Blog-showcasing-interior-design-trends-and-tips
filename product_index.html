                <h3>OUR APPROACH</h3>

                <h3>LIVING ON THE CANALS OF AMSTERDAM</h3>
                <p>A classic Dutch houseboat built in the 1980's situated in one of the most prestigious canals of Holland's capital Amsterdam, de Keizersgracht got transformed into a high-quality future-driven design that inspires. To work. To rest. To move. And above all, to enjoy life on the wateA brief description of the product goes here. It highlights the key features or uses.The houseboat was bought by the local owners of the house right in front of the boat who loved an extension of their house for visitors, a creative workspace on the water and personal gym.</p>
                <h3>OUR PROCESS</h3>
                    <p>For this project we partnered with interior designer Bob van Zonneveld. Together we crafted a smart design to renovate and modernize the boat while preserving the unique feeling of living on the water.</p>
                    <h3>HOMELY YET MODERN AND MINIMALISTIC</h3>
                        With its picturesque views of the canals and typical Amsterdam houses along lining the water’s edge, the houseboat offers a homely yet modern and minimalistic living space.
                        
                        From a modern, high quality kitchen with ceramic kitchen work top to a wardrobe wall that enhances space and creates a loft-like feeling, and a unique, handcrafted bathroom piece perfectly tailored to the space.

                <h3>COLOR MINIMALISM COEXIST</h3>
                <p>Minimalism is not just for neutral hues and black and white. In this project, we proved that a material as rich and exuberant as purple velvet can also exist in a minimalistic space.

                    In our opinion, design is more fun when there is a mixture of contrasting elements. In this project, we we blended a colorful Italian design interior with clean lines and neutral elements. We combined aesthetics that at first glance might feel like a paradox and juxtaposed them strategically to create balance and harmony.A brief description of the product goes here. It highlights the key features or uses.</p>
                    <h3>OUR PROCESS</h3>
                        <p>Ankie’s vision was clear from the beginning, she wanted to combine the warmth of Italian design with round shapes and elegant finishes. Together with an architect friend, she sketched the design and we refined the drawings.
                        
                        One of our priorities was to create more storage space in the apartment. An excellent example of that is the layout of the cupboards.</p>
                        <h3>EXQUISITE AND SUSTAINABLE</h3>
                            <p>We used an array of beautifulbeautirul sustainable materials in this project. For example, the bookcase is made of walnut; the kitchen, window sill, and cabinets are made of sprayed MDF; and the kitchen and bathroom worktop are made of Hi-Macs Solid Surface.</p>
